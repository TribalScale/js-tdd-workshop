# TDD

## What?
 - disciplined approach to writing software
 - follows two rules
   - Test-First Programming
     - Write new code only if a test has failed
   - Refactoring
     - Removes code smells

## Why?
 - encourages more thinking about the implementation
 - promotes "learning" culture
 - creates a "safety net" for making changes
 - improves the design of your API
 - executable documentation

## When?
 - ALWAYS!!

## How?
 - Red/Green/Refactor
 - Red
   - Write a small amount of test code, watch the test fail. Ensure that it fails as expected!
 - Green
   - Write a small amount of implementation code. Only enough to pass the test! Don't worry about design or elegance
     - DRY
     - YAGNI
 - Refactor
   - improve the code without breaking any of the existing tests. Here we focus on design and elegance
 - Repeat!
 - SMALL. INCREMENTS.
